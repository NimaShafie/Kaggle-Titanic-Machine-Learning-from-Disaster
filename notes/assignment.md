## The Challenege:
Build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Category of ML we will use: Since we are determining if a passenger has survived or not, we will be using a binary classifier to determine the target here.

Models we may implement:
+ Logistic Regression
+ K-Nearest Neighbors
+ Decision Tree
+ Support Vector Machine
+ Naive Bayes
